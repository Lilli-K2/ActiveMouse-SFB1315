These are the pictures used in the tutorial.
We used [this picture](https://github.com/Lilli-K2/ActiveMouse/blob/main/pictures/MausFreunde.png) for lick_image in the ActiveMouse code and [this picture](https://github.com/Lilli-K2/ActiveMouse/blob/main/pictures/warning2.png) for no_lick_image. You can choose whatever pictures you like as long as you provide the correct path in the ActiveMouse code.
The other images contained in this folder are used in the tutorial to explain how the gui is to be used.
