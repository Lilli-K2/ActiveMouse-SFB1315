This is the code for ActiveMouse. It is designed to generate a pop-up with images indicating how well an animal is being tracked by dlc-live
and provide you with three figures immediately after stopping the recording indicating how well your animal was being tracked and the animal's general activity
during it.
The code can be freely adapted to your needs ranging from using different video resolutions, choosing alternative images, setting the accuracy threshold (lik_thresh) to various values, tracking new points and so on.
